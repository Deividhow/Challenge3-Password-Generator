# Challenge3-Password-Generator

## Description
This project is pretty straight foward, this is a password generator. This project was meant to be able to make the users life a little more simple by creating a random generated password so the person doesnt have to struggle with comming up with a password that may be to easy to guess by other people. Most people use things that are to easily guessable such as names, birthdays and many other things that are closely related to them. This can make it easy for people who know a little information about you to guess your password. With this project you can generate a password from 8 to 128 characters that have a mixture of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters at a completly random order. This project ended up helping me memorize more of javascript so it becomes more second nature. This really helped with just practicing writting code over and over again.



## Installation

 To run this project all you need is the url and start answering the prompts and in a matter of seconds you will have a randomly generating password.
